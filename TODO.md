# TODO

Priority queue:
- [x] benchmark rosenbrock
- [x] export objectives
    - [ ] name objectives
    - [ ] how to do random objective
        - [x] we need random oracle,
              this one is easy, we
              just need to add random
              number to the gradient.
        - [ ] we would like to test
              many different noise
              distributions.
        - [ ] divide objectives into
              easy objectives, with
              known function, where 
              we just add a random noise
              to the gradient oracle.
        - [ ] rosenbrock function, 
              which has a different
              noise type (it's
              composite) we will do 
              as a separate test.
- [ ] 
- [ ] write the whole thing up
